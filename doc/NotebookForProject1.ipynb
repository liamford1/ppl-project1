    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to explore (A) compiling arithmetic and boolean expressions with let-bindings into a __stack machine bytecode__ and (B) writing an emulator to execute this bytecode. This is all to be done in standalone scala using VSCode or some IDE such as IntelliJ that supports `sbt` (Scala Build Tools).\n",

    "__AI Usage Policy__: You are allowed to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Github co-pilot and other tools, to help you with this project. However, it is not needed. The project can be solved on your own without any AI help. We will have a compulsory survey on AI use that needs to be completed by every student who attempts this project. Please be honest in your survey responses.\n",
    " - Please do not ask us to rescue you when AI tools fail you. We are not going to help you debug code that you got from AI tools.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parts to a machine: \n",
    " - The list of instructions. The machine interprets these instructions one by one starting from the beginning and stops when there are no more instructions.\n",
    " - The environment stack: this stack contains entries each of which is a pair _(identifier, value)_. The value can be a number or a boolean while the identifier is a string.\n",
    " - The operand stack: this is a stack of values. Once again values can be number or boolean. \n",
    " \n",

    "We have three types of values:\n",
    " - `Num(d: Double)` -- this is a numerical value of double precision type.\n",
    " - `Bool(b: Boolean)` -- this is a boolean value.\n",

    "Instructions are typically of the following types:\n",
    " - _Arithmetic or Boolean instructions_: these operate purely on the operand stack. For instance `IPlus` will pop the top two values from operand stack and if they are numbers, it will add them and push the result back. On the other hand, if there are less than two values left in the stack or they are not numbers, then a environment error results (signalled by throwing an exception and bailing out).\n",
    " - _Environment Stack Instructions_: these operate on the environment stack/operand stack. They include `IStore, ILoad`, and `IPop`. We will describe them below.\n",
    " - _Jump Instructions_: We will have two jump instructions that modify the control flow -- `ICondSkip(_)` is a conditional skip and `ISkip(_)` is an unconditional skip. They are also described below. \n",

    "- `IPush(d)`: push the value `Num(d)` onto the operand stack. Note that `d` is a Double precision number whereas the operand stack is one of _values_. \n",
    "- `IPushBool(b)`: push the value `Bool(b)` onto the operand stack. Note that `b` is a Boolean whereas the operand stack is one of _values_.\n",
    "- `IPop`: pop off the top element of the operand stack - throw an exception if the stack is empty.\n",
    "- `IPlus`: pop two values from the stack, if they are numerical values (of the form `Num(_)`) then add them and push the resulting numerical value back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `ISub`: pop two values from the stack: let the first value be of the form `Num(v1)` and second value be `Num(v2)`, subtract them as `v2 - v1` (this order is very important) and push the result `Num(v2 - v1)` back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `IMul`: Same as `AddI` except that we multiply the two numerical values. \n",
    "- `IDiv`: pop two numbers from the stack, let the first number popped be `Num(v1)` and second number be `Num(v2)`, IDivde them and push `Num(v2 / v1)` back (this order is very important). Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations orthe two values popped off are not both numbers. Throw exception if IDivsion by zero.\n",
    "- `IGeq`: pop two values from the stack: let the first value be of the form `Num(v1)` and second value be `Num(v2)`. Push `Bool(v2 >= v1)` back onto the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `IGt`: pop two values from the stack: let the first value be of the form `Num(v1)` and second value be `Num(v2)`. Push `Bool(v2 > v1)` back onto the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers.\n",
    "- `IEq`: pop two values from the stack (they may be numbers or booleans). Compare them for equality and push the boolean value result back onto the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `INot`: pop one value off the stack and if it is of the form `Bool(b)` then push the value `Bool(!b)` onto the stack. If the value popped off is not a Boolean or the stack is empty during any pop operations, raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the specification for the instructions that work off environment and operand stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IStore(identifier)`: The instruction pops one value `v` off the operand stack and \n",
    "pushes the pair `(identifier, v)` on the environment stack.\n",
    "- `ILoad(identifier)`: The instruction scans the environment stack starting from the top until it finds the first value of the form `(identifier, v)`. It pushes `v` onto the operand stack. If in this process, it reaches the end of the stack without finding an entry corresponding to  `identifier`, raise an  exception with an error message that the identifier is unbound.\n",
    "- `IPop`: pop the top element off the environment stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the two instructions that modify the control flow:\n",
    "- `ICondSkip(n)`: here $n \\geq 1$ is a positive number. This is the conditional jump operation. We pop the top element off the operand stack and if it is a boolean value `false`, we skip the next $n$ instructions resuming execution off the $n+1$th instruction. If it is `true`, then we simply proceed to the next instruction. If the stack is empty, value on top of the stack is not a boolean or we have less than $n$ instructions after the current one, then raise an exception.\n",
    "- `ISkip(n)`: here $n \\geq 1$ is a positive number. This is the unconditional jump operation.  We skip the next $n$ instructions resuming execution off the $n+1$th instruction. If we have less than $n$ instructions after the current one, then raise an exception.\n",

    "### Implementing Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scala's immutable Lists as stack. \n",

    " - `length` gives us the length of the stack.\n",
    " - `isEmpty` checks if empty.\n",
    " - `head` of the list allows us to get the top element of the stack.\n",
    " - `tail` of the list allows us to pop off the top element and outputs a list without the top element.\n",
    " - `push` is just consing the new element to the front.\n",
    " - Another useful method is `find`: http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-8-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-collection-functions/scala-find-function/\n",

    "\n",
    "  - The use of while, for loops and mutables var is prohibited. \n",

    "  - Any recursive functions used for the emulator (part 1 of assignment) must be made `tail recursive` and the annotation `@tailrec` must be used. This however does not apply to part 2 of this assignment below."
